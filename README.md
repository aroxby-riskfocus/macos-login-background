# macos-login-background

Sets the current wallpaper to the login background.

**WARNING:** For MacOS Mojave ONLY at this time.

**WARNING:** This program does NOT check if the background image meets login screen requirements.  Use with care.

**Usage:**
```
sudo python main.py
```

**NOTE:**
If have FileVault enabled you will have to edit some login setting (eg: *Show password hints*) to force the pre-environment to update.  You can change this setting back without having to logout.
